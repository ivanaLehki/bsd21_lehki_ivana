<p>…The <strong>Ragdoll</strong> is a cat breed with a color point coat and blue eyes. …Its form is large and muscular and its coat is silky soft and semi-longhair. …Ragdolls were developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s. …They are best known for their docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. …The name ‘Ragdoll’ is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.</p>
